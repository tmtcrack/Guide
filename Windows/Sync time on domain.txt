To sync the client time with the domain controller using the Command Prompt, you can follow these steps:

Open the Command Prompt as an administrator. You can do this by searching for "Command Prompt" in the Start menu, right-clicking on it, and selecting "Run as administrator."

In the Command Prompt, enter the following command and press Enter:

Copy

w32tm /resync /rediscover
```
This command tells the Windows Time service (w32time) to resynchronize the time with the domain controller and rediscover the time source.

Wait for the command to complete. The Windows Time service will contact the domain controller and update the client's time.

Verify the time synchronization by running the following command:

Copy
w32tm /query /status
This command displays the current status of the Windows Time service. Look for the "Last Successful Sync Time" to ensure that the time synchronization was successful.

By following these steps, you can use the Command Prompt to sync the client time with the domain controller on Windows. It's important to have a properly configured and synchronized domain controller to ensure accurate timekeeping throughout the domain.
