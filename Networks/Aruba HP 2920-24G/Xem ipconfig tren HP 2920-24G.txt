On an Aruba HPE 2920-24G switch running ArubaOS-Switch, you can check the IP configuration using the following commands in the switch's CLI:

To view the IP address configuration of a specific interface (e.g., VLAN interface or management interface), use the following command:

bash
Copy code
show ip interface vlan <VLAN_ID>
Replace <VLAN_ID> with the VLAN ID or interface name you want to check.

To see the IP routing table, use:

bash
Copy code
show ip route
This command will display the routing table on the switch.

To check the IP address assigned to the management interface, use:

bash
Copy code
show management
This command should display information about the management interface, including its IP address.
