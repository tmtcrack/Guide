 Ahmer M  January 30, 2019  MySQL
MariaDB is a famous fork of MySQL relational database management system. Just like it predecessor MariaDB is also free and open source under the GNU GPL license. MariaDB is community-developed and commericially supported. MariaDB is developed by some of the original developers of MySQL.

Since, it’s initial fork from MySQL, MariaDB has been enhanced with many new features. Currently, it’s stable version 10.3.12 is available to use.

In this article, we will install MariaDB 10.3 on CentOS 7 server.

 

System Specification:
We have a virtual machine with following specifications:

Hostname - mariadb-01.example.com
IP Address - 192.168.116.130/24
Operating System - CentOS 7.6
MariaDB Server - 10.3.12
Installing MariaDB 10.3 Server on CentOS 7

Installing MariaDB 10.3 on CentOS 7:
Connect to mariadb-01.example.com using ssh.

MariaDB packages are available through standard yum repositories. However, we are installing MariaDB 10.3.12 (latest stable version while writing this article) therefore, we have to either download its tarball from MariaDB Downloads or we can add the MariaDB yum repository.

download-mariadb-10.3.12-stable
We are installing MariaDB yum repository as follows.

# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mariadb.repo
Add following directives therein.

[mariadb]
name=MariaDB
baseurl=http://yum.mariadb.org/10.3/centos7-amd64
gpgkey=https://yum.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
Before using MariaDB yum repository, we must import the GPG public key to verify the digital signatures of the packages in this repository.


Although, it is not necessary to import the GPG public key manually. The GPG public key will be automatically installed by yum, when we install a package from MariaDB yum repository for the first time.

Here, we are importing the GPG public key manually for the sake of demonstration.

# rpm --import https://yum.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
Build yum cache using following command.

# yum makecache fast

# mysql_secure_installation

NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

Enter current password for root (enter for none):
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
root user without the proper authorisation.

Set root password? [Y/n] Y
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!


By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

Cleaning up...

All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MariaDB!
